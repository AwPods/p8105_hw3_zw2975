## Problem 1

``` r
# Import data
library(p8105.datasets) 
data("ny_noaa")
```

#### short descirption of the dataset:

The `ny_noaa` dataset has variables `id`, `date`, `prcp`, `snow`,`snwd`,
`tamx`, and `tmin`.

This dataset has 2595176 rows and 7 columns.

Missing date should not impact the analysis result drastically since
there are already too many missing values for `tmin`, `tmax`, `snow`,
and `snwd`.

#### Clean ny_noaa

``` r
# make dates cleaner
ny_noaa <- ny_noaa %>%
mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date), day = day(date))

# character to numeric, integer to numeric
ny_noaa <- ny_noaa %>%
  mutate(tmin = as.numeric(tmin)) %>%
  mutate(tmax= as.numeric (tmax)) %>%
  mutate(snow = as.numeric(snow)) %>%
  mutate(snwd = as.numeric(snwd)) %>%
  mutate(prcp = as.numeric(prcp))


# relocate the variables and rename them
ny_noaa <- ny_noaa %>%
  relocate(year, month, day) %>%
  rename(precip = prcp, snowfall = snow, snowdepth = snwd) %>%
  relocate(id)


# commonly observed value for snowfall
ggplot(ny_noaa, aes(x = snowfall)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs (title = "snow fall distribution",
        x = "snow fall (mm)",
        y = "count in observation") 
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

According to the histogram of snowfall, the most commonly observed value
for snowfall is 0 mm.

Comment From the table, we can see that the dataset have more
participants who received education more than high school level. For
male, there are more participants who received high school equivalent
education compared to female. The age distribution graph also reflects
on the numbers from the table. The more than high school education
category has the most observations and participants who age younger tend
to fall into this education level. The age distribution for less than
high school and high school equivalent education levels have very
similar.

#### total activity against age

``` r
# new variable: total activity
nhanes <- nhanes |>
mutate(total_activity = (rowSums(nhanes[, 6:ncol(nhanes)], na.rm = TRUE)))

  labs(
    title = "Total activity vs. age by gender and education level",
    x = "age",
    y = "total activity",
    color = "sex") # I want more readable x axis numbers
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

##### Comment

Same as what we observed in the previous graphs, this scatter plot also
shows more participants falling into the more than high school education
level. However, the total activity of participants across the 3
education level does not seem to have big difference. There is one very
obvious outlier for more than high school education level, which is a
male participant who almost have 0 total activity minutes.

When we look at the trend lines, both female and male tend to have a
negative trend of age vs. total activity time and they have very similar
slope.

\##### comment For every education level, the line all appears to be
declining and increasing then declining to reflect a person’s activity
level during the 24 hrs period. During the middle of the day, which is
around 500 minutes, the smooth trend line roughly reaches its maximum
since it is around 10 am in the morning. When the line reaches somewhere
over 1000 minutes, it starts declining, reflecting the end of work
hours.

## Problem 3

``` r
jan2020 = read.csv("./data/citibike/Jan 2020 Citi.csv")

jan2024 = read.csv("./data/citibike/Jan 2024 Citi.csv")

july2020 = read.csv("./data/citibike/July 2020 Citi.csv")

july2024 = read.csv("./data/citibike/July 2024 Citi.csv")
```

##### description of datasets

The 4 Citibike datasets contain number of observations reflecting on the
number of rides for each combination of year and month.

All of them have the exact same number of variables, which is
`ncol(jan2020)`, with the same names: `ride_id`, `rideable_type`,
`weekdays`, `duration`, `start_station_name`, `end_station_name`, and
`member_casual`.

In order to easily distinguish between the month and year for the
datasets after appending them, I will create 2 variables, year and
month, for each dataset before the merge.

#### Clean datasets

``` r
# Make variables to distinguish the dates
jan2020 <- jan2020|>
  mutate(year = 2020) |>
  mutate(month = "Jan")


july2020 <- july2020|>
  mutate(year = 2020) |>
  mutate(month = "July")

jan2024 <- jan2024|>
  mutate(year = 2024) |>
  mutate(month = "Jan")

july2024 <- jan2024|>
  mutate(year = 2024) |>
  mutate(month = "July")

# Combine datasets
citibike = rbind(jan2020, july2020, jan2024, july2024)
```

##### data description

Right now, all the datasets are combined together with 2 newly added
variables `year` and `month` to help distinguish when the observation
was from.

The combined dataset `citibike` has `ncol(citibike)` columns and
`nrow(citibike)` rows.

##### comment

According to the table, members tend to ride way more than non-members
for all 4 combinations of year and month.

For both members and non-members, the number of rides kept going up
until the January of 2024 and stayed the same after that.

##### Comment

For both non-members and members, the ride for electric bike has a
higher time compared to classic bikes. The distribution for all 4
comparisons are sharply right-skewed. Interestingly, members tend to
ride more classic bike compared to non-members.

The duration of rides in January are much higher for both members and
non-members.
