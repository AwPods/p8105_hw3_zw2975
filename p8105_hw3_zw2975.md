## Problem 1

``` r
# Import data
library(p8105.datasets) 
data("ny_noaa")
```

#### short descirption of the dataset:

The `ny_noaa` dataset has variables `id`, `date`, `prcp`, `snow`,`snwd`,
`tamx`, and `tmin`.

This dataset has 2595176 rows and 7 columns.

Missing date should not impact the analysis result drastically since
there are already too many missing values for `tmin`, `tmax`, `snow`,
and `snwd`.

#### Clean ny_noaa

``` r
# make dates cleaner
ny_noaa <- ny_noaa %>%
mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date), day = day(date))

# relocate the variables and rename them
ny_noaa <- ny_noaa %>%
  relocate(year, month, day) %>%
  rename(precip = prcp, snowfall = snow, snowdepth = snwd) %>%
  relocate(id)

# commonly observed value for snowfall
ggplot(ny_noaa, aes(x = snowfall)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs (title = "snow fall distribution",
        x = "snow fall (mm)",
        y = "count in observation") 
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

    ## Warning: Removed 381221 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range
    ## (`stat_bin()`).

![](p8105_hw3_zw2975_files/figure-gfm/clean%20data-1.png)<!-- --> \#####
According to the histogram of snowfall, the most commonly observed value
for snowfall is 0 mm.

#### panel plots

``` r
# in January
ny_noaa|>
     group_by(id) |>
  filter(month == 1) |>
  summarize(mean_jan = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = id, y= mean_jan )) +
  labs(title = "January max temperature",
       ylab = "Temperature (in tenths)",
       xlab = "station id")
```

    ## Warning: There were 658 warnings in `summarize()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `mean_jan = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)`.
    ## ℹ In group 1: `id = "US1NYAB0001"`.
    ## Caused by warning in `mean.default()`:
    ## ! argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 657 remaining warnings.

#### panel plots 2

``` r
# takes a long time the process the data, need to get rid of NAs
ny_noaa2 <- ny_noaa |>
  filter(!is.na(tmax), !is.na(tmin))

ggplot(ny_noaa2, aes(x = tmax)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +

## Problem 2

``` r
acceler = read.csv("./data/nhanes_accel.csv")
demog = read.csv("./data/nhanes_covar.csv")
```

#### data cleaning

``` r
# column names for the demographic dataset on 4th row
colnames(demog)<-demog[4,]

# get rid of useless rows
demog <- demog[5:254,]

# clean names 
demog<-janitor::clean_names(demog)
acceler <- janitor::clean_names(acceler)

# get rid of missing demographic data
demog <- demog |>
  na.omit()
  
# change acceler dataset "seqn" to a character variable
acceler <- acceler |>
  mutate(seqn = as.character(seqn))

# merge 2 datasets
nhanes <- inner_join (demog, acceler, by = "seqn")

# get rid of people under 21
nhanes <- nhanes |>
  filter(age >= 21)
```
